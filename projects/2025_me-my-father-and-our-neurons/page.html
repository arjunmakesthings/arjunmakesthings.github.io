      <p>my father left me & my mother when i was 19. in 2025, it had been 6 years since i last spoke to him.</p>
      <p>as time passed, i began forgetting what he looked like, how he talked, and how he behaved. often, i would stumble upon old media that showed me close to him, but fail to recall those memories. on one hand, that was good — i was starting to let go. on the other, parts of me desperately wished for us to meet; so that i could preserve these memories in their original form.</p>
      <p><em>me, my father & our neurons</em> invited strangers to influence my dilemma. physical-units made with clay represented neurons in either my brain or my father's, depending on where a person placed it. each neuron accessed a different memory.</p>

      <p>if two neurons with the same memory were found in both our brains, the program made a 'link' between them. if the two neurons were left far apart, the person decided that we should fade out of each other's lives. if they were placed close together, the person was suggesting that we should meet & preserve our memories.</p>

      <p>every 3-minutes, i took a snapshot of all the links, and calculated a score based on their distance that suggested whether i should let go (linked-neurons placed apart from each other) or reach out (linked-neurons placed close to each other).</p>
      <p>the itp-winter-show audience accessed 5723 memories, and decided that i should let go.</p>
