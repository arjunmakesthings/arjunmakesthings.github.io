        — an observability platform that financial institutions use to identify,
        diagnose, and resolve errors across their distributed components. in
        2025, i was hired as a design-consultant, to work on ambiguous asks.
      </p>
      <p>
        while the product was complex, and comprised many modules, there were
        only two types of distinct pages where people consumed information —
        listing-pages (with cards, panels, et-cetera), and table-pages (with
        many rows & columns).
      </p>
    </div>

      <p>
        in both cases, finding a specific item was laborious. there
        <em>was</em> a search-bar, but it only allowed people to perform keyword
        searches.
      </p>

      <p>
        to facilitate more complex searches on pages with tables, vunet had
        built its own query-language (<a
          href="https://vunetsystems.com/docs/vusmartmaps/vunet-query-language/"
          >vql</a
        >). this allowed people to write functions & expressions to find
        specific items across loads of entries. however, using vql assumed an
        understanding of the language & its syntax, which only 'advanced-users'
        were expected to have. therefore, the ability to write vql queries was
        limited to specific pages.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/projects/2025_vusearchbar/5.gif" id="white" />
        <figcaption>
          if a person encountered a vql-enabled search bar, they had to visit an
          external documentation-website to understand its syntax (and then come
          back to the original page to use it). this was impractical, since
          vusmartmaps was not an exploration-based product — it was meant to
          help people do specific things, in the least amount of time possible.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        so, i proposed a contextually-aware search-bar, that could be deployed
        across different pages on the platform, helping people find specific
        items quicker. the idea was to help people:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <mark>know <em>what</em> they can search for</mark>, when they see the search-bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          <mark>understand <em>how</em></mark> they can perform a search, when they activate
          it.
        </li>
        <li><mark><em>narrow down</em></mark> their search, as they type.</li>
        <li>
          <em><mark>remain syntactically correct</em></mark>, if they try to build a
          vql-query.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

        i accounted for all possible keyboard-triggers (and the resulting
        suggestions), error resolution (if people were syntactically incorrect),
        and left room in the design for the query-language to grow in the
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        to demonstrate digital-tactility and technical-feasibility*, i also built a
        javascript-prototype.

        * a person from the engineering-team was concerned about the number of
        calls we'd have to make to the backend, in order to recommend items to a
        person as they typed. so, the prototype demonstrated how the search-bar
        could store items locally (in different arrays), and perform searches
        locally (instead of sending calls to do so externally).
