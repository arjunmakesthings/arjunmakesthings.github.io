        — an observability platform that financial institutions use to identify,
        diagnose, and resolve errors across their distributed components. in
        2025, i was hired as a design-consultant, to work on ambiguous asks.

      <p>
        while the product was complex, and comprised many modules, there were
        only two types of distinct pages where people consumed information —
        listing-pages (with cards, panels, et-cetera), and table-pages (with
        many rows & columns).

        in both cases, finding a specific item was laborious. there
        <em>was</em> a search-bar, but it only allowed people to perform keyword
        searches.
      </p>

      <p>
        to facilitate more complex searches on pages with tables, vunet had
        built its own query-language (<a
          href="https://vunetsystems.com/docs/vusmartmaps/vunet-query-language/"
          >vql</a
        >). this allowed people to write functions & expressions to find
        specific items across loads of entries. however, using vql assumed an
        understanding of the language & its syntax, which only 'advanced-users'
        were expected to have. therefore, the ability to write vql queries was
        limited to specific pages.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/projects/2025_vusearchbar/5.gif" id="white" />
        <figcaption>
          if a person encountered a vql-enabled search bar, they had to visit an
          external documentation-website to understand its syntax (and then come
          back to the original page to use it). this was impractical, since
          vusmartmaps was not an exploration-based product — it was meant to
          help people do specific things, in the least amount of time possible.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        so, i proposed a contextually-aware search-bar, that could be deployed across different pages on the platform, helping people find specific items quicker. the idea was to help people:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>know <em>what</em> they can search for, when they see the search-bar. </li>
        <li>understand <em>how</em> they can perform a search, when they activate it. </li>
        <li><em>narrow down</em> their search, as they type. </li>
        <li><em>remain syntactically correct</em>, if they try to build a vql-query. </li>
      </ul>
