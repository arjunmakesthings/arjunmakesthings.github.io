      <p>i wanted to make a series of algorithmically-generated images that expressed how it felt like to exist in this world. however, this enquiry was cut-short by my move to new-york. these are the two lines of thought that i was able to realise.</p>

      <h1>co-existence:</h1>
      <p>The world is made up of many unique 'cells'. These cells are nothing more than densely packed particles of energy, generated by a core, linked by 'personalities'. Some cells generate more energy, take up more space, and, therefore, have more 'personalities'. The closer one cell is to another, the more 'personalities' they can interact with.</p>
      <p>However, in this world, cells are scared. They form groups and communities, while some stay away. Even in the most intimate settings, when one cell is <em>only</em> interacting with one other cell, they fail to penetrate beyond each other's outermost personalities. Amidst these superficial connections, the cells continue to co-exist — giving each other space to be themselves — and afraid of discovering what the core of another cell contains.</p>

      <h3>logic:</h3>
      <p>First, I thought about the cell and began from its core. Energy particles (vertices in space) are generated from the center and spread outwards in somewhat a circular fashion. A line passes through them, creating a closed shape. This is one 'personality' of the cell. Each cell has at-least 16 personalities.</p>
      <p>Then is the problem of occupying space. When they are being given birth, one after the other, the system decides a position and number of personalities that this new cell will have. The system cares about containing as many cells as it can possibly have, without two of them being in deep connection. Cells can only exist as close as two outermost personalities interacting with each other.</p>
      <p>If a cell does not fit in the system, or is connecting too closely with another cell, it is modified & reborn as another cell that fits the system according to the rules.</p>

      <h1>energy-exchanges:</h1>
      <p>The world is made up of many 'cells'. Each cell generates 'energy' particles — from its core — and radiates it outward. All cells live amidst a continuous exchange of these energy particles.</p>
      <p>Some cells have a wider spread of energy — and take up more space than others. This also means that, probabilistically, they participate in more external energy exchanges. However, their internal being is widely spread out. Others have a lesser spread of energy, and are more densely packed within themselves — closer to their core.</p>
      <p>No two cells can occupy the same physical space at a given point in time. They may get extremely close, and participate in an intense energy exchange, but never live in the exact position as another cell in the system.</p>

      <h3>Logic:</h3>
      <p>First, I thought about the cell and began from its core. Energy particles (very small points in space, building blocks) are generated from the center and spread outwards in somewhat a circular fashion. The cell is not a solid shape, but only a densely packed collection of these energy particles.</p>
      <p>Next comes the problem of occupying space. When they are being given birth, one after the other, the system decides a position and energy spread radius (or size of the cell). The system only cares about itself, and its optimal functioning, and keeps deciding new positions and sizes until the cell finds a space that no other cell is occupying. The cell can play its part there.</p>
      <p>Finally, the cells can participate in the energy exchange. Energy is sent to and received by many cells at the same time, without the consent of the cell. Essentially, the cells have no will of their own, and only perform their responsibilities as a 'cell' — existing in the system and giving + taking energy.</p>
