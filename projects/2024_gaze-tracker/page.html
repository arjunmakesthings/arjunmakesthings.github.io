        Since college, I wanted to conduct eye-tracking studies for the products
        that I was working on. However, a Tobii eye tracker was (and is) very
        expensive for an individual to buy. One day during my time at Treemouse,
        we were discussing the possibility of creating in-house research tools â€”
        to make data gathering and analysis easier, faster and more diverse. I
        suggested the idea of a browser-based eye tracking tool and spent the
        next weekend prototyping it, with the help of the
        <a href="https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/#contact" target="_blank"
          >WebGazer library</a
        >
        developed by Brown University.
