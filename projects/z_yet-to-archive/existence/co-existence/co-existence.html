<h1>Thought</h1>
<p>The world is made up of many unique 'cells'. These cells are nothing more than densely packed particles of energy, generated by a core, linked by 'personalities'. Some cells generate more energy, take up more space, and, therefore, have more 'personalities'. The closer one cell is to another, the more 'personalities' they can interact with.</p>
<p>However, in this world, cells are scared. They form groups and communities, while some stay away. Even in the most intimate settings, when one cell is *only* interacting with one other cell, they fail to penetrate beyond each other's outermost personalities. Amidst these superficial connections, the cells continue to co-exist — giving each other space to be themselves — and afraid of discovering what the core of another cell contains.</p>
<h1>Logic</h1>
<p>First, I thought about the cell and began from its core. Energy particles (vertices in space) are generated from the center and spread outwards in somewhat a circular fashion. A line passes through them, creating a closed shape. This is one 'personality' of the cell. Each cell has at-least 16 personalities.</p>
<p>Then is the problem of occupying space. When they are being given birth, one after the other, the system decides a position and number of personalities that this new cell will have. The system cares about containing as many cells as it can possibly have, without two of them being in deep connection. Cells can only exist as close as two outermost personalities interacting with each other.</p>
<p>If a cell does not fit in the system, or is connecting too closely with another cell, it is modified & reborn as another cell that fits the system according to the rules. </p>
