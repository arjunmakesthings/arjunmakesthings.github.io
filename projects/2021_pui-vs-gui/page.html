        in 2021, i found it fascinating that technological discourse globally
        spoke about gestural-input being the future of
        human-computer-interaction (<a
          href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/need-a-machete-not-a-memo-niti-aayogs-arvind-virmani-on-why-msme-reform-needs-more-than-new-laws/articleshow/122105837.cms"

        & <a href = "https://www.wired.com/story/gadget-lab-podcast-496/ " target="_blank">2</a>),
        but no one discussed <em>by how much?</em> so, when tasked with writing
        a research paper during my third year of undergraduate study, i focused
        my enquiry around trying to quantitatively compare a
        head-tracked-interface with a graphical one.
      </p>
      <p>
        at the time, i saw an increasing use-case for head-tracked interfaces in
        environments such as hospitals, where people were asked a standard set
        of questions with binary answer possibilities (such as the
        <a
          href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA4132.pdf" target = "_blank"
          ><em>osha-covid-screening-questionnaire</em></a
        >).

      </figure>

      <p>
        i used a blob-tracking algorithm to develop a head-tracked-interface,
        where a person could tilt their head to choose between either of two
        displayed options (such as <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em>).
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        for the graphical-interface, i used a google-forms form on a laptop.
        other usability gimmicks were stripped off from both interfaces, to
        ensure that comparison was restricted to the efficiency of input
        modalities.

      <h1>experiment design:</h1>
      <p>
        the idea was to make multiple people complete a subset of the
        osha-questionnaire (3/16 questions), using both interfaces,
        one-at-a-time. by recording them doing this task, i could compare the
        total time they took to answer each question via both input modalities
        (finger-on-trackpad versus head-movement).
      </p>

          input modalities.

      </figure>

      <p>
        then, smaller computing-actions to answer each question were broken down
        via an adaptation of the goms-keystroke-level-model — originally
        proposed by jef raskin in
        <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface " target="_blank"
          ><em>the humane interface</em></a
        >. jef proposed that the total time taken to complete a task on a
        computer system is the sum of elementary gestures that the task
        comprises (such as moving the mouse pointer, clicking a key, moving
        between the mouse & keyboard, et-cetera).

      <p>
        in the given time frame and conditions, i was only able to perform this
        experiment with 5 people.
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr id="separator" />

    <div class="text-container">
      <h1>findings:</h1>
      <p>
        there was a <mark>~0.5s decrease in input time</mark> for each question,
        after participants comprehended it, on the head-tracked interface. this
        suggests that perceptual-interfaces might be more efficient in
        situations where time to complete a task is vital.
      </p>

      <p>
        next, people had to perform <mark>~1.6 lesser steps</mark>, on average,
        while using the head-tracked interface (according to the ‘steps’ defined
        on the goms-keystroke-level-model). these steps include tasks like:
        scrolling, removing their fingers from the trackpad after scrolling,
        pointing to the answer choice, et-cetera. this finding can be
        interpreted as lesser effort / energy being expended by people who use a
        perceptual-interface. however, the exact difference could not be
        accurately measured.
      </p>

      <p>
        lastly, via follow-up questions, i established that all of the
        participants found the head-tracked interface
        <mark>easier to use</mark>. however, a couple of them said that using
        the trackpad felt more ‘natural’ (since they were accustomed to it),
        which presented an interesting hypothesis to pursue in the future — how
        much does digital literacy impact the interface-effectiveness comparison
        between a perceptual and traditional interface?
      </p>

      <p>
        so, i concluded my paper empirically by stating that
        perceptual-interfaces work better (faster & with reduced effort) than
        graphical ones, albeit with the acceptance that my study was done in a
        hyper-controlled environment, with zero error rates, with a
        lesser-than-ideal sample size.
