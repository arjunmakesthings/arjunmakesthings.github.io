        <p>dahiya tore-down my burgeoning prejudice against recent forms of first word art: when i tried to criticise AR/VR, he cut me off, pointed at a light-switch, and wondered how ‘<mark>flicking a mechanical switch to fire electrons that illuminate a bulb far away’ is no less crazy than ‘wearing a virtual-reality headset</mark>’.</p>

        when tom asked us to make a simple interactive system with physical controls for his introductory class, i couldn't shake away dahiya's words. today, we frequently interact with electricity — in-fact, we consume 24,398,000,000,000,000 watt-hours of electrical-energy every year<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> — and, yet, there is a lot that we don't understand about how it works<sup><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        as i dug deeper to understand how electricity works, tom redirected me to kenn amdahl's book: <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10796575-there-are-no-electrons" target="_blank">there are no electrons</a></em
        >. he writes (while attempting to explain what moves between wires):

          It’s Little Greenies. <br /><br />
          That’s right. Little Greenies. It’s not electrons at all. Electrons are a myth, a superstition. They don’t make sense, they’re boring, and they’ve never been proved. Shoot, I’ve never seen an electron, have you? Of course not. No one has. Sure, the electron theory seems to work a lot of the time, but so did the Flat Earth Theory. The theories of Aristotle, Newton and Euclid appeared to work pretty well, too, for a few hundred years. Now they seem childish. All because bold and adventurous thinkers like you and me were willing to consider alternatives. Elegant and innovative alternatives, like The Greenie Theory.

        i wanted to communicate this magic — continuous, laborious work happening around us, by electrons (or little green things), to achieve 'simple' tasks like lighting up an <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode" target = "_blank">led</a>.
