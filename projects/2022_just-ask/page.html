        <a href="https://www.unfpa.org/">unfpa</a> approached
        <a href="https://www.tinkerlabs.in/">tinkerlabs</a> to conceptualise &
        design an ai-enabled chatbot, with the intention of improving
        sexual-health awareness amongst adolescents in low-resource regions of
        india. i helped conduct design-research, and led conversation-design,
        with a 4-person team.

          >launch in madhya-pradesh</a
        >, 25, 000+ unique adolescents had interacted with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        through design-research visits to villages in madhya pradesh, we
        established information-seeking patterns in adolescents — the triggers,
        sources and outcomes. over time — and with internet-data — we concluded
        that there were 8 emotional needs that adolescents were trying to meet,
        by going to unreliable sources for sexual-health queries.
      </p>
      <p>
        via a
        <a href="https://www.duretechnologies.com/">technology partner</a>, we
        understood the technical limitations of whatsapp, and proposed 173
        feature, tonal and identity ideas for the chatbot. i then prepared a
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wizard-of-oz/"
          >wizard-of-oz</a
        >
        system that enabled human-researchers to process & respond to open-ended
        text messages, just like an ai-enabled chatbot would in the future.
