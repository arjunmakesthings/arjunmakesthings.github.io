        in 2021, anurag took a workshop on filmmaking for
        third-year-communication-design students at iiad. the objective was for
        students to understand the fundamentals of filmmaking, and produce a
        short documentary film with their smartphones.

        being a rock-climber myself, i found the reasons behind why different
        people climb fascinating, and decided to explore this via filmmaking.
        so, i hung out at my local climbing gym for two days with an iphone-7,
        spoke to ten people, found patterns in their answers, and made this
        four-minute long film.
