        photolapse was a computer program written as a comment against persistent video surveillance in the world. it uses the webcam to capture photographs of random dimensions from the webcam-feed, and places them at random positions on a canvas every second. over time, images become layered and movement across time starts to become visible — but it is difficult for humans to establish continuity (since the images are placed randomly).
