      <p>
        in the summer of 2021, i was a product design intern at
        <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/canonic#canonic"
          >canonic</a
        >
        — a low-code backend development platform. the web-application allowed
        people to create entire backend systems by using a graphical interface
        (like a ‘<a
          href="https://www.wix.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=22079466192^173454183576^search%20-%20wix&experiment_id=wix^e^727706622124^&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22079466192&gbraid=0AAAAADwEfwUh0W84OdW8tT7eE2XDbvr7l&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxJvBBhDuARIsAGUgNfiYp60KzTVOkMev4DGpZb4ahboy9Hf6nxxeDNpAOOSjY8CsQp2a0E0aAkIuEALw_wcB"
          >wix</a
        >’, but for backend).
      </p>
      <p>
        we noticed that it was difficult for people, irrespective of their
        programming experience, to build their first application on canonic.
        once they figured their way around the platform, they were able to adapt
        it to their specific use-cases. in fact, 83% of people never finished
        the onboarding and 75% of them dropped out after completing the first
        (out of three) stages. so, i focused a chunk of my time redesigning
        their onboarding experience.
      </p>

      <h1>problems:</h1>
      <p>
        <mark>high cognitive load:</mark> the onboarding prompts often had
        irrelevant, lengthy explanations, and took a lot of time for people to
        comprehend. when i observed people going through the onboarding
        experience, many of them missed key information (since they skimmed
        through it quickly) and went on to make inaccurate choices later.
      </p>

      <figure id = "white">
        <img src="/projects/2021_canonic-onboarding/problem 1.webp" />
      </figure>

      <p>
        <mark>no intimation about errors:</mark>
        once they took an action that prevented them from going ahead, they
        couldn’t understand why. this also occurred when many steps were
        combined into one (such as entering a name, selecting a type and
        clicking on a button), and their error would have been on the first step
        (but they would assume it was on the last).
      </p>

        <img src="/projects/2021_canonic-onboarding/ErrorGIF.gif"  id = "white"/>
        <figcaption>
          trying to proceed, but unable to do so and not knowing why. it's
          because i've written 'author' instead of 'authors', but the product
          doesn't tell me that.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        <mark>generalisation:</mark>
        a person, especially someone who wishes to use a tool to make something specific, wants to know how the tool will aid their process of creation. however, canonic made them choose between 3 projects, and asked them to learn the tool first, without considering their level of programming experience and what they wanted to ultimately build with the tool. the limited list of ‘mock-projects’ deterred people, and they misestimated the scope of what canonic could help them build.
      </p>

      <p>
        <mark>multiple dead ends:</mark>
        there were many cases where a person may arrive at a dead end in the onboarding flow, unable to figure out how to progress ahead, and would quit instantly. when i studied the architecture, i realised that this was a possibility in almost all the steps.
      </p>

    <div class = "text-container">
      <h1>outcomes:</h1>
      <p>i first suggested an ‘adaptable’ information-architecture, allowing the team to create any application on canonic and marking it as an onboarding project with a simple toggle. this meant that the team (or ‘power-users’ in the future) could make their own onboarding projects, that the platform would then be able to guide a person through.</p>

      <figure id = "white">
        <img src = "/projects/2021_canonic-onboarding/IA.webp">
      </figure>

      <p>next, i looked at all possible canonic-actions that may occur, and suggested a system of context-specific visual-prompts. the idea was that developers could modify the type of prompt that comes up for a specific step, and it would have only the required amount of content (instead of force-fitting one prompt-design with multiple hidden features).</p>

      <p>here is a video demo that explains all the changes i made, and why:</p>

        <p>this was the first time i built something that was released in the world into the hands of actual people. so, i also wrote an <a href = "https://arjunmakesthings.medium.com/what-lies-beyond-making-digital-experiences-53382e2c28dc">article</a> on medium that discusses my learnings.</p>
