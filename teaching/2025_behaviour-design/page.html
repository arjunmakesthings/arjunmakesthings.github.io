        tested low-fidelity prototype as a solution. i ran a section
        independently, and conducted common sessions to facilitate ideation &
        prototyping for 120 students.

        more projective-research (as opposed to conversational), and more
        iterations (as opposed to finesse).

        my goal as an educator was to help students learn the ability to switch
        between a 'generating-many' mindset and a 'selecting-few' one; so that
        the world has more enterprising (future) team-leaders, product-managers
        and senior-executives. i did this by busting myths about a ‘good’ idea
        and a ‘bad’ one, helping them generate wacky ideas by applying humour,
        restrictions & time-limits, setting class norms about what ‘mindset’ to
        use (dreamy vs analytical), and helping them be okay with visually
        shabby work.

        i asked students to make a prototype for a very specific kind of alarm
        clock, and we used those to understand differences between 'good' and
        'bad' prototypes. images:

        in my last session, i gave each student in my section 7-minutes to
        submit (or not submit) an anonymous-note that answered the question —
        <em>what stayed with you after these 9 days?</em> these are some
        responses:
