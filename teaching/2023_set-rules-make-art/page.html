        i was invited by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/seekh/">seekh</a>, a
        student-run organisation at
        <a href="https://www.mitid.edu.in/">mit-institute-of-design</a> to
        introduce creative-coding to 180+ undergraduate students. together, we
        learnt how to <em>think</em> like a computer (programmatic-thinking),
        <em>talk</em> to a computer (introduction to p5.js syntax), and
        <em>make</em> with a computer (p5.js drawing exercises).

      <h1>think:</h1>
      <p>
        i introduced students to the idea of ‘instructional-art’, with examples
        from sol-lewitt and yoko-ono. we explored what good instructions (rules)
        are, by creating a live input / output system in class — students wrote
        a set of instructions, dropped it in a box, and picked up a set of
        someone else’s instructions to follow (and make a drawing).
      </p>
      <p>
        we chuckled at the fact that computers are dumb — often requiring a set
        of very specific, sometimes laborious, instructions to perform simple
        tasks.

      <h1>talk:</h1>
      <p>
        we explored language, and understood why it’s important to talk to a
        computer in a language it understands. from there, we moved on to
        high-level programming languages, and i introduced basic drawing syntax
        via simple exercises.

    <div class="text-container">
      <h1>make:</h1>
      <p>
        slowly, i introduced students to more computational concepts such as
        variables, loops, pseudo-randomness and interactivity (via mouse-clicks,
        keyboard, et-cetera), while working with them to realise individual
        final compositions. we then ended the workshop with a display of these
        compositions.
