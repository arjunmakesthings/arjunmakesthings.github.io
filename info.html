        at new-york-university, on a near-full scholarship. most of my time now
        is spent in preparing for the move across the world, saying goodbyes to
        people & places, and getting this website up-to-date.

      <h1>past:</h1>
      <p>
        i grew up all across india, moving with / between my parents, and
        studying in seven different schools. i was athletic & curious, and
        aspired to become a professional athlete.
      </p>
      <p>
        when that didn't pan out, i pivoted to design, and studied
        communication-design at <a href="https://www.iiad.edu.in/">iiad</a>,
        delhi. my professors moved me, and i became naively inspired by
        the idea of using design to change the world. work also introduced me to
        the artistic potential of programming, and i used it as a gateway into
        interdisciplinary work. i worked with
        <a href="https://bengaluru.sciencegallery.com/xperimenter-programme"
          >science-gallery-bengaluru</a
        >
        in my final year — programming a
        <a href="/projects/2022_in-between-life-and-death/page.html"
          >web-game</a
        >
        and exploring
        <a href="/projects/2022_earth-2052/page.html">citizen-science</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        after graduating, i worked as a design-researcher for 2+ years — at
        <a href="https://www.tinkerlabs.in/">tinkerlabs</a> and
        <a href="https://treemouse.com/">treemouse</a> — in their social-impact
        practices. disillusioned by the industry, i resigned to grow my own practice, and did
        design-research, product-design, creative-coding and taught design in
        undergraduate & postgraduate programs.
