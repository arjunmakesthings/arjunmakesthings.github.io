I studied visual design at a tiny college in New Delhi, where persistent acts of rebellion against the notion that designers shouldn't engineer, pushed me to produce interdisciplinary work. As a result, in my final year, I was invited by Science Gallery Bengaluru to join the Xperimenters Programme. This was a first-of-its-kind programme in the country, where four young adults interacted with leading experts in diverse disciplinary fields and produced public engagement projects for young adults to interface with the sciences.</p>
<p>
I spent my time sitting in biophysics labs and making simulations, discussing human needs and wants with a theoretical computer scientist, programming a web game based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs, and presenting a climate-anxiety analysis of 200+ crowdsourced drawings of the Earth in 2052 at an international youth symposium.

For economic reasons, I then spent the next two years of my life working with behaviour design consultancies. There, I largely led design research for projects that aimed to enable access / adoption in some of the lowest-resource environments in the country. A significant contribution of mine was conducting ethnographic research for and leading the conversation design of the 'Just Ask' chatbot, an AI-enabled chatbot launched by UNFPA to improve sexual health awareness amongst adolescents in the country. During this project, I spent time in rural Madhya Pradesh understanding the information-seeking behaviour of adolescents, performing wizard-of-oz tests for WhatsApp chatbots, suggesting technological approaches to the design of the query bank and losing an ethical battle of allowing women under 18 to access pregnancy-related information. 
</p>
<p>
I then chose to step away from a fairly stable career in design research for 'social impact', because I believed that there were fundamental problems that funders weren't willing to solve. Instead, a lot of time was spent on higher-order problems, to produce 'better-looking' solutions that can be passed off in the global 'innovation' discourse. Now, I operate as an independent design consultant; engaged in dutiful product-design work for a brilliantly, but hastily designed observability platform for financial institutions, postgraduate teaching and mentorship for UX students, and artistic research that looks at the potential of code as a creative medium.
