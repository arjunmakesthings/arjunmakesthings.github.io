All of my work originates from either of two distinct starting points — </p>

<ol>
<li><p>when <em>someone</em> asks me to make <em>something</em> for a group of <em>people</em> to meet a certain <em>target</em></p></li>
<li><p>when something in the world ignites my <em>wonder</em></p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Work that originates from [1] often begins by sharpening the ask — <em>what</em> are we really making, <em>why</em> are we making it and what does meeting the <em>target</em> mean for us? Then, time is spent in collecting information via specific groups of people and the internet. The found information produces a new list of micro-asks which, if satisfied, will eventually lead to the fulfilment of the original, bigger ask. Different ways to satisfy each micro-ask are explored via a loop of making, showing and changing; eventually arriving at an assortment of outcomes that are likely to fulfil the original ask.</p>
<p>
Work that originates from [2] leads to the formation of a thought — <em>what happens if … / can … / is it possible to …</em> , etc. The thought then demands to be expressed or realised. So, it is pushed through a process of ‘making’. Since the world around me makes more sense to me in terms of rules, numbers and steps, the ‘making’ is often governed by a system of logic. This results in the creation of an artefact that can most likely be experienced via the sense of sight.

<p>Find a PDF of my CV <a href = "/files/CV_November2024.pdf">here</a> or read below to get a quick overview.</p>
<p>I studied communication design at the Indian Institute of Art & Design where I was naively inspired by the idea of using design to change the world. I also stumbled upon the artistic potential of programming and used it as my gateway into interdisciplinary work. For my graduation project (and most of my final year), I worked with Science Gallery Bengaluru as part of their <a href = "https://bengaluru.sciencegallery.com/xperimenter-programme">Xperimenters programme</a> where I programmed a <a href = "/projects/2022_in-between-life-and-death/page.html">web-game</a> and explored <a href = "/projects/2022_earth-2052/page.html">citizen science</a>.</p>
<p>After graduating, I worked as a design researcher for 2+ years at two organisations in their social impact practices and resigned to grow my own consulting practice. I now work independently — with people or organisations to [a] do design research, [b] teach or [c] employ creative-coding to deliver interactive and / or performative experiences largely over the web.</p>

<p>I work 3 days/week with VuNet Systems, as part of a small product-design team with <a href = "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://in.linkedin.com/in/setwrite&ved=2ahUKEwi-upn7lYKLAxXin2MGHQyXIhoQFnoECBAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw29c3lZCwKclbTu4__UiOb4">Shobhan</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://in.linkedin.com/in/arkoprabho-bhattacharjee&ved=2ahUKEwjE1qyVloKLAxUbzzgGHTK-OnEQFnoECB4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw2ZRcD1Zuv_cmHANDfO6SQX">Arko</a>, <a href = "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://in.linkedin.com/in/sankalp-kanchan&ved=2ahUKEwiFu5ObloKLAxVDxTgGHc9nLrMQFnoECBgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2OcwwM9iHnQKnLtU_z7Qy0">Sankalp</a> and <a href = "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://in.linkedin.com/in/bhavanasodha&ved=2ahUKEwjB9NejloKLAxWM1jgGHdyIOrwQFnoECBAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1VBSI8JuPP35WUlSt0L5_o">Bhavana</a>. The product is a powerful & complex observability-platform for financial institutions to diagnose and resolve errors across their distributed components. I spend most of my time working on ambiguous asks, led by curiosity & rigour, while making cases for uniform-patterns across the product. </p>
<p>
In the days that remain, I balance time between my own computational practice, a project with <a href = "https://slow.studio">Slow Studio</a>, writing and mentoring a few UX/UI diploma students at AND Academy.</p>
<p>Apart from work, I regularly sport-climb and am, also, learning how to play the piano. Truthfully, I try to keep my brain occupied most of the time; otherwise I might crumble.</p>

The fastest way to reach me is by email @arjunmakesthings[at]gmail.com. I respond to (almost) everything that I get there. I am also on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjunmakesthings/">LinkedIn</a>, but prefer to keep my connections limited to people that I’ve actually met before (with a handful of exceptions).
