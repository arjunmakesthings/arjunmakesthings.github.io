All of my work originates from either of two distinct starting points — </p>

<ol>
<li><p>when <em>someone</em> asks me to make <em>something</em> for a group of <em>people</em> to meet a certain <em>target</em></p></li>
<li><p>when something in the world ignites my <em>wonder</em></p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Work that originates from [1] often begins by sharpening the ask — <em>what</em> are we really making, <em>why</em> are we making it and what does meeting the <em>target</em> mean for us? Then, time is spent in collecting information via specific groups of people and the internet. The found information produces a new list of micro-asks which, if satisfied, will eventually lead to the fulfilment of the original, bigger ask. Different ways to satisfy each micro-ask are explored via a loop of making, showing and changing; eventually arriving at an assortment of outcomes that are likely to fulfil the original ask.</p>
<p>
Work that originates from [2] leads to the formation of a thought — <em>what happens if … / can … / is it possible to …</em> , etc. The thought then demands to be expressed or realised. So, it is pushed through a process of ‘making’. Since the world around me makes more sense to me in terms of rules, numbers and steps, the ‘making’ is often governed by a system of logic. This results in the creation of an artefact that can most likely be experienced via the sense of sight.

<p>Find a PDF of my CV <a href = "/files/CV_November2024.pdf">here</a> or read below to get a quick overview.</p>
<p>I studied communication design at the Indian Institute of Art & Design where I was naively inspired by the idea of using design to change the world. I also stumbled upon the artistic potential of programming and used it as my gateway into interdisciplinary work. For my graduation project (and most of my final year), I worked with Science Gallery Bengaluru as part of their <a href = "https://bengaluru.sciencegallery.com/xperimenter-programme">Xperimenters programme</a> where I programmed a <a href = "/work/design/in-between-life-and-death/in-between-life-and-death.html">web-game</a> and explored <a href = "/work/design/earth-2052/earth-2052.html">citizen science</a>.</p>
<p>After graduating, I worked as a design researcher for 2+ years at two organisations in their social impact practices and resigned to grow my own consulting practice. I now work independently — with people or organisations to [a] do design research, [b] teach or [c] employ creative-coding to deliver interactive and / or performative experiences largely over the web.</p>

I work 3 days / week with VuNet systems as part of their small UX team (<a href = "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://in.linkedin.com/in/setwrite&ved=2ahUKEwiVp_-0ssqKAxXlyzgGHbV8InAQFnoECB0QAQ&usg=AOvVaw29c3lZCwKclbTu4__UiOb4">Shobhan</a>, <a href = "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://in.linkedin.com/in/arkoprabho-bhattacharjee&ved=2ahUKEwj-lLjDssqKAxWJxDgGHbXxOPIQFnoECBcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2ZRcD1Zuv_cmHANDfO6SQX">Arko</a>, <a href = "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://in.linkedin.com/in/sankalp-kanchan&ved=2ahUKEwjvhvbfssqKAxVMxzgGHVDYD9IQFnoECBoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2OcwwM9iHnQKnLtU_z7Qy0">Sankalp</a> & me). VuNet has built a powerful observability platform that financial institutions use to identify, diagnose and resolve different errors across their distributed components. I spend most of my time working on ambiguous asks, led by curiosity and rigour. 
</p>
<p>
In the days that remain, I balance my time between graduate applications, building this archive, catching up on WIP ideas and mentoring six students from AND Academy on their UX-diploma capstone projects. 
</p>
<p>
Apart from work, I am getting to back to the active lifestyle that I had before; playing and climbing regularly, with the occassional hike. I am also living in a perpetual attempt to say more 'yeses' than 'nos'.

The fastest way to reach me is by email @arjunmakesthings[at]gmail.com. I respond to (almost) everything that I get there. I am also on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjunmakesthings/">LinkedIn</a>, but prefer to keep my connections limited to people that I’ve actually met before (with a handful of exceptions).
