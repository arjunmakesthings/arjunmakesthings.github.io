        I studied visual design at a tiny college in New Delhi, where persistent
        acts of rebellion against the notion that designers shouldn't engineer,
        pushed me to produce interdisciplinary work. As a result, in my final
        year, I was invited by
        <a href="www.google.com">Science Gallery Bengaluru</a> to join the
        Xperimenters Programme. This was a first-of-its-kind programme in the
        country, where four young adults interacted with leading experts in
        diverse disciplinary fields and produced public engagement projects for
        young adults to interface with the sciences.

        I spent my time sitting in biophysics labs and making simulations,
        discussing human needs and wants with a theoretical computer scientist,
        programming a web game based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs, and
        presenting a climate-anxiety analysis of 200+ crowdsourced drawings of
        the Earth in 2052 at an international youth symposium.
      </p>
      <p>
        For economic reasons, I then spent the next two years of my life working
        with behaviour design consultancies. There, I largely led design
        research for projects that aimed to enable access / adoption in some of
        the lowest-resource environments in the country. A significant
        contribution of mine was conducting ethnographic research for and
        leading the conversation design of the 'Just Ask' chatbot, an AI-enabled
        chatbot launched by UNFPA to improve sexual health awareness amongst
        adolescents in the country. During this project, I spent time in rural
        Madhya Pradesh understanding the information-seeking behaviour of
        adolescents, performing wizard-of-oz tests for WhatsApp chatbots,
        suggesting technological approaches to the design of the query bank and
        losing an ethical battle of allowing women under 18 to access
        pregnancy-related information.
      </p>
      <p>i may even have blockquote, like so:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          someone said something beautiful, and i wish to record it as is.
          someone may also say something very, very, very, very, very, very,
          very, very ,very, very long.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I then chose to step away from a fairly stable career in design research
        for 'social impact', because I believed that there were fundamental
        problems that funders weren't willing to solve. Instead, a lot of time
        was spent on higher-order problems, to produce 'better-looking'
        solutions that can be passed off in the global 'innovation' discourse.
        Now, I operate as an independent design consultant; engaged in dutiful
        product-design work for a brilliantly, but hastily designed
        observability platform for financial institutions, postgraduate teaching
        and mentorship for UX students, and artistic research that looks at the
        potential of code as a creative medium.
