      <p>my body is wrapped inside a permeable membrane.</p>
      <p>
        beautiful things find their way to me. they, leisurely, interact with
        parts of my body; at-will, on-demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        i long for them to stay. to settle, to make a home, to transmute into an
        object of permanence and sit at the root of my very being; grounding my
        suspended body back to the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        i prepare myself; i clear space, more so than required, to ensure that
        they live comfortably. i clean, making sure that the surface feels
        impeccable. i now simply await; anticipation drooling down to the floor,
        like a child waiting to unwrap a christmas present that was diabolically
        hidden from him for 24 long years.
      </p>
      <p>
        however, they simply pass through me; sometimes, instantaneously —
        relieving themselves of a future and donning strange names of the past
        — 'memories', 'experiences', 'activities' and 'people'.
      </p>
      <p>my body is <s>wrapped</s> trapped inside a permeable membrane.</p>
