        When I think about the world, I imagine a system — many organisms
        perpetually interact with one-another, each governed by its own set of
        rules, collectively unpredictable & complex; with the occasional
        sprinkle of universal noise. My artistic practice is wholly devoted
        towards the pursuit of understanding and representing this semi-ordered
        nature of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up all around India, moving with / between my parents and
        studying in as many as seven different schools. Every two years, I was
        an outsider in a well-established social system; <em>desperate</em> to
        fit in. As a somewhat reserved child, I began observing and replicating
        behaviours considered favourable by certain groups of people, in the
        hopes of being accepted by them. During the first few weeks at a new
        school, I would pick out the corner bench in class and carefully study
        the rules of social interaction in that environment. When patterns
        emerged, I made slight adjustments to my personality and tried to see if
        my hypothesis of becoming more appealing to people in that group stood
        true. Years later, during my undergraduate education in design, I would
        find a succinct term for what I had been doing all those years —
        ‘research’.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would argue that I have been a researcher all my life, even before the
        systematic way of channelling curiosity was formally introduced to me.
        In school, I was kicked out of classes for asking ‘more than necessary’
        and, sometimes, ‘unanswerable’ questions. To make friends, I studied
        people and tried behavioural experiments. As a student-athlete, I kept
        logs of training schedules & performances to understand what stimuli
        worked best. Throughout childhood, there remained a formally unharnessed
        attachment between me and the scientific method, perhaps due to the
        absence of an open academic playground.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating high school, the results of two aptitude tests directed
        me towards an undergraduate education in design. In the first month, we
        were all sat down in a classroom and were being introduced to a course
        that required our participation for the next three months. I remember
        visible dissent in that classroom — none of us could figure out how or
        why this would be helpful in our careers as designers. I did what I
        always had when something didn’t sit well with me — I raised my hand and
        asked the professor <em>why</em> we were being asked to take this
        course. As soon as the words left my mouth, I expected a ‘sit down’ or
        ‘get out’. To my surprise, she <em>answered</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I would learn through practice in the next four years, curiosity was
        essential to be a designer and there were ways to channel it without
        getting kicked out of class. In my first three years, I explored
        conventional domains within the ‘bubble’ of design such as brand,
        interaction and product design. In doing so, I inadvertently also
        explored psychology, engineering, mathematics, biology, etc. As I made
        more projects, I began to realise that design could exist in-between
        academic confines, draw connections and present these to people in
        digestible formats.
      </p>
      <p>
        To put this definition to the test, I joined the Xperimenters programme
        at Science Gallery Bengaluru for my thesis. A first-of-its-kind
        programme in the country, the organisation invited four young adults to
        interact with leading experts working in diverse disciplinary fields. I
        spent my time sitting in biophysics labs, distinguishing between human
        needs & wants with a theoretical computer scientist, and learning web
        development with a creative technologist. Each conversation formed the
        base for new creative work, all of which are logged
        <a
          href="https://arjunsnotion.notion.site/Arjun-s-Thesis-4a732af0f22542128c1d80a64147557a"
          >here</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I developed <em>In Between Life & Death</em> — a
        <a
          href="https://arjunmakesthings.github.io/projects/2022_in-between-life-and-death/page.html"
          >web game</a
        >
        for young adults that tried to convey why human beings do what they do.
        The game was built on my interpretation of
        <em>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Human Needs</em> and allowed players to
        control a particle that progresses through ‘life’; by meeting
        requirements of each hierarchy. With the game as a tool, I facilitated
        two workshops with 50+ young adults — discussing human needs, happiness,
        and the existence (or inexistence) of a purpose in human life.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Xperimenters programme ended, I knew with resounding clarity
        that this was the kind of work that I wanted to do with my life, but
        failed to find an economically viable way to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, for the past three years, I have been ‘semi-masquerading’
        as a design researcher during the day — asking questions to make
        products for people in low-resource environments and, at night, letting
        my computational art enquiry take me where it takes me. This skewed
        scale is what I want to fix via my time at the Interactive
        Telecommunications Program at NYU.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to spend more of my time making things reflective of my
        worldview and seeing how other people experience them; all while
        engaging more foundationally & critically with my craft. Since two
        hundred diverse students share the same umbrella interest, I also
        envision an exchange of similar & contradicting viewpoints — forcing my
        practice to exist outside of the protected space that I share with my
        computer. This not only offers me the chance to exponentially diversify
        my worldview, but also work towards defining it more precisely. NYU also
        houses faculty members whose work I have seen & admired over the
        internet. Interacting and, perhaps, collaborating with them will help me
        pave a clearer path for my future — whether it lies in an independent
        art practice, academia or full-time job.
