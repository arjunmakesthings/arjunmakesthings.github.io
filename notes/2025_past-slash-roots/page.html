        i find myself losing track of my past as i grow up, and choosing to omit
        details in conversations. so, these are the major events that i can
        recall, before i moved across the world to begin a new chapter in my
        life:
      </p>

      <p>
        born in srinagar. dad in the army; mum left her dreams for the family.
        joyous child, non-cribby, active, chubby is what i'm told. move around —
        city after city — following dad. play football, see someone receive an
        award for playing football, decide to win that award myself. win it. mum
        & i stay back in delhi; i play for youth-teams and she restarts her
        career. dad keeps moving.
      </p>

      <p>
        start getting recognised, live like an athlete, and say no-s throughout
        middle school. mum & i often fight; grades suffer; i only care about
        football. the words — <em>you're not a prodigy</em> — keep bouncing
        around; i become desperate for attention & recognition. act out; get
        medically diagnosed with adhd.
      </p>

      <p>
        girls give me attention; i use it. date; dump; play with feelings; turn
        into an asshole without realising it. argue; get thrown out of classes;
        fight; get beaten up; i play football, sometimes for >4 hours a day, but
        win lesser & lesser awards around better players. i'm a teenager now.
      </p>

      <p>
        dad shows up with a parental epiphany; decides i'm ruining my life; bans
        football; moves me in with himself to drill-in military discipline. cry;
        break trophies; tear jerseys; nothing changes. i am now in a small town
        in madhya-pradesh; this school doesn't even have a football team. mum
        now lives by herself in delhi.
      </p>

      <p>
        live by a routine; get 30-minutes a day to operate my phone; get forced
        out of bed at 8am on sundays. i'm unhappy. we have a dog; i talk to the
        dog. keep seeing dad revered; he tells everyone that i'll turn out
        better. mum & dad meet less often; i don't know why.
      </p>

      <p>
        get better grades; enjoy studying; exercise; own a 'physique'. i don't
        have many friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        it is summer; the family decides to climb a mountain together. dad
        ridicules mum, mum reacts; suppressed issues rise up; they fight; they
        separate. we don't reach the summit. i like dad more, live with him and
        don't talk to mum as such.
      </p>

      <p>
        high school; study numbers; begin to realise that i'm decent at many
        things. spend summers in mountaineering schools; meet older people;
        observe mid-life crises; read thoreau; climb peaks; nearly die, survive.
        find friends; get into a relationship; watch sunsets with the dog. feel
        lonely.
      </p>
      <p>
        aptitude tests suggest design; decide to pursue it in delhi. mum & dad
        get divorced; they had been waiting, i was told; i live alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        learn & make things in the day; climb & train in the evenings. i rarely
        have skin on my fingers, and wear cargo pants to college. i have a
        girlfriend; i've had sex. everything is romanticised; art is beautiful;
        i can express.
      </p>
      <p>
        fall; break; get lost; decision-paralysis. climber or designer?
        romantically commit? worthy? good enough? future? past? make decisions;
        find people; lose people; make many, many things.
      </p>
      <p>covid.</p>
      <p>
        let go of climbing; commit to design. i now want to be the best. burn
        bridges; ruin friendships; speak to my computer; move out. i now work,
        sometimes, for 16 hours a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        move to bangalore; work with science & art; considered "smart"; dream of
        studying at mit.
      </p>
      <p>
        move to mumbai; i now want to change the world and go to mit after a
        year. work with behaviour design, research, and impoverished people.
        earn money; spend money. fall in love; face demons. get rejected from
        mit; break down. attempt suicide; fail. i am now labelled by mental
        health professionals. decide to get out.
      </p>
      <p>
        move to gurgaon; i just want to do impactful work. gurgaon doesn't suit;
        move out. decide to move in with my girlfriend; i can't live alone
        anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        move to bangalore; scared. it's happy for a while; then it isn't. the
        past explodes; i move out; we break up. we try, fail, cry, end. i can't
        move on. breathe, despite trying otherwise. life slowly claws back. i
        have a hole, but i have other ones filled. good work finds me; i evolve.
        get into nyu; decide to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        decide to accept help from others, perhaps for the first time in 7
        years. it pours in. i find family; reunite with s; put in work to repair
        bridges previously decimated. i am now in an airplane, flying from delhi
        to new-york; supported by hands that i cannot see.

        i wrote this, under a clever disguise, to — in a way — <em>escape</em>
        my past. to <em>move on</em>; by ending a chapter, before beginning a new
        one. i was wrong; the roots of my present shall forever be entangled in
        my past.
      </p>
      <p>life was never meant to be a linear narrative.</p>
