        May 12th, 2022: I found myself bowing in conclusion in front of an
        external panel of jurors, faculty and mentors as I wrapped up my final
        project presentation. Four years at the Indian Institute of Art & Design
        had led me to that one slide, and everything after that was something
        that I wasn’t prepared for.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        Just like that, it was all over. A wave of congratulations, some
        critical & constructive discussions, and a couple of goodbyes later — I
        walked out of the institute for the final time. I do not seem to recall
        my exact feelings at that moment, but vividly remember that it felt
        somewhat like an unsettled goodbye. Things that remained unsaid, bottled
        up inside me, screaming to be heard.
      </p>
      <p>
        so, this piece of writing is my feeble attempt at closure — to say
        everything to everyone, and to myself. By doing so, I hope to end this
        chapter of my book, record my learnings succinctly, and try to inform
        other college students around the world by using my experience as an
        exemplar. This is what I leave my four-year journey at IIAD with.

        Eugène Delacroix is often quoted with the line,
        <em
          >“experience has two things to teach. The first is that we must
          correct a great deal and the second, that we must not correct too
          much”</em
        >. This stands true for this reflection as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are things that went right for me, and things that I
        <em>now</em> wish I had done differently. In this article, I wish to
        cover both viewpoints, and leave the takeaways to your own judgement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr id="separator" />

    <div class="text-container">
      <p>there are four things that went right:</p>
      <h1>a teacher-student relationship beyond the usual paradigm:</h1>
      <p>
        One of the good things about studying in a design school is that you’re
        introduced to <em>mentorship</em>. Apart from the usual delivery of
        lectures and explanations of theoretical & practical concepts, your
        relationship with professors need not end there. They are equipped to
        shape your professional practice and inform your understanding of life,
        should you seek a student-teacher relationship that goes beyond the
        ordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing a meaningful student-mentor relationship requires an overlap.
        The student must be willing to know more, to extract more from the
        person of experience and knowledge. By fulfilling the student’s
        curiosity, mentors are also subjected to rethink the concepts that they
        teach, better articulate them for a detailed explanation and sometimes
        even build upon them because of a question put forth by the incessantly
        inquisitive student.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was always like this. I wanted to know the <em>‘why’</em> behind
        everything, and it got me into a lot of trouble in grade school.
        However, in design, this ‘annoying’ curiosity is appreciated and even
        desired in a student. I often found myself questioning professors in
        their lectures, asking them why they were teaching a concept in a
        certain way, what was the reason behind restricting us to a particular
        format and even sometimes blatantly asking them why they were teaching
        that course at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        This burning desire to know more forged some extremely meaningful
        relationships for me during my four-year-long journey. I started out as
        a student without any formal training in art or design and by the end of
        it, I was discussing course structures with professors and proposing
        changes to them. In another case, a mentor sustained his relationship
        with me even after he left the institute and helped me during my project
        even though he wasn’t academically obligated to do so.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/notes/2022_undergraduate-study/2.webp" />
        <figcaption>
          One of my most cherished relationships is with this professor, which
          has now lasted for more than 3 years. She not only helped me carve out
          my academic path but also made me aware of who I am as a person and
          what I can do to do to make a better life for myself. I jokingly refer
          to her as my second mother.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Mentors such as these have provided me with opportunities that I would
        have otherwise never had access to, a platform to collaborate with them
        and a definitive source for answers when I couldn’t arrive at one,
        whether in work or in life. A teacher or professor will guide you
        through a project or lead you to a particular outcome, but a mentor will
        remain a guide for life and I’m fortunate to have quite a few of them.
      </p>
      <h1>developing my own way of thinking:</h1>
      <p>
        One of the things that I’ll forever be grateful to IIAD for was the
        opportunity to form my own way of thinking. In every field of work,
        people attempt to solve problems. Usually, a prescribed template is
        followed because it’s successfully worked in the past and change is an
        unnecessary risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        In design, however, you’re empowered with the opportunity to question
        everything. Therefore, there is no compulsion to follow a prescribed
        template. Of course, most people end up doing so because it saves time
        and effort but some people don’t. Fortunately, I became one of them.3
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/notes/2022_undergraduate-study/3.webp" />
        <figcaption>
          One of the things from our first-year curriculum that I adopted very
          seriously was the concept of a mind map. Often, all my projects
          resulted in huge sheets of paper with pieces of information linked to
          one another using cause and effect + network thinking. image:
          <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/alina-khatri-5a9471167">alina</a>.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Epistemology, pedagogies, methodologies, frameworks, thinking tools,
        approaches … I became an absolute nerd for these. When I came across a
        new approach to solving problems or a new system to classify
        information, my eyes would light up like a Christmas tree. Come to think
        of it, I was sometimes more fascinated by the <em>concept</em> of
        problem-solving rather than solving the problem itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time at the Science Gallery Bengaluru as well as in my
        interviews for a full-time job, I realised that the world outside also
        appreciates this approach; where you’re reconstructing processes based
        on the requirements of the problem at hand. Of course, some
        organisations also view this as a problematic trait. In a lot of my
        interviews, I sensed this and politely declined before we could discuss
        further. However, if you are someone like me, I would like to tell you,
        with great amounts of affirmation, that there are people and
        organisations around the world that value this enthusiasm and,
        sometimes, you might just be hired because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When has anything radical come out from a slight modification to
        something that was already done before? People who want to innovate will
        always look for other people who want to shake things up and wade
        through the difficult waters of the unknown; for that is where the gold
        lies.
      </p>
      <h1>travelling alone:</h1>
      <p>
        Before the <em>beloved</em> pandemic, I somewhat lived the life of a
        dirtbag climber: travelling on a budget, backpacking, climbing peaks and
        rock faces; most of it alone. I was the sort of guy who would pack up a
        bag and head out, without knowing where I was going. When I narrate my
        stories to people now, they are fascinated and often tell me that I have
        lived multiple lives. At that time, I did not comprehend that what I was
        doing at 19 were things that grown-up people would crave for in their
        adult lives. This realisation was so fascinating.
      </p>

          Often, a bag and a crashpad would be the only things accompanying me.

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        In 2022, I felt like a grown-up. I felt how I was now bound by
        responsibilities. A friend described this realisation as ‘being sucked
        into the corporate hole’. Although I don’t quite agree with her
        pessimism, there is an undeniable change in the amount of freedom one
        can exercise while working, compared to the freedom available in
        college.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am glad that I made the most out of this. I would often pack a bag and
        leave for the weekends and spend my holidays climbing peaks or rock
        faces.

      </figure>
      <p>
        What this did was fulfil a sense of adventure that all human beings have
        as a fundamental need before I joined a workplace. It informed my
        understanding of life and what we city dwellers consider normal as I was
        subjected to many extremes during my travels (mostly because I couldn’t
        afford comfort). It also developed my perspective on what things are
        universal and unite people around the world together, and what are
        variable and temporary results of culture. This knowledge became
        fundamental when trying to make products for human beings of the world.

      <p>there are four things that i wish i did differently.</p>
      <h1>Sustaining relationships:</h1>
      <p>
        What stung me the most as I walked out of the gates of my college for
        the last time was the number of people in my batch that I interacted
        with on my last day and conversed beyond small talk. Zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t get me wrong, my batch has some wonderful people with whom I had
        the opportunity to share time and space with. Some of the most memorable
        moments of my life are with them. I’ve lived with these people, I’ve
        laughed with these people, I’ve cried with these people and I’ve loved
        with these people. However, with time, each of these relationships was
        ruined. By the end of my final year, I was left with none.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/notes/2022_undergraduate-study/6.webp" />
        <figcaption>
          Two of the most precious people that I had the opportunity to be
          friends with. This image feels like such a distant past as if it
          happened with two complete strangers. image:
          <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/ashishdodamani">ashish</a>.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Over time, we grow comfortable with putting the blame on other people;
        viewing them as the problematic ones. The destructive image of a
        successful lone wolf was so fiercely desired by me that when I reached
        some semblance of success, I realised how it means nothing when you
        don’t have people to share it with.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was like that for me. I had a fantastic project and subsequent jury,
        as well as a solid plan for the next year at least, but I was so
        unsettled by the fact that I could not even talk to a single person from
        my batch. I realised this in November and moved out to Bangalore in
        January for my final project. I remember discussing reasons for doing so
        with a friend and I said, “I just want to save myself the pain of
        walking into class every single day and being rendered invisible”.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not like I didn’t have the right people to forge relationships with
        but that I was incapable of fighting for them and sticking through the
        bad times. If you’re in a space where you have the luxury of meaningful
        relationships, do everything in your power to protect them. Detaching
        yourself and hoping that the void will be filled up by something else is
        a futile activity.
      </p>
      <h1>Letting other people take control over my narrative:</h1>
      <p>This is the bitter part of my bittersweet experience.</p>
      <p>
        Aesop wrote that
        <em
          >“every truth has two sides; it is as well to look at both, before we
          commit ourselves to either”</em
        >. The problem arises when one side becomes the prevailing perspective
        because the other chooses to run away. My sides to stories about me
        remained contained within me and ran away with me, for I did not have
        the energy to sit and defend my character against people whom I had once
        loved and who loved me back because of my very character. Strange to see
        how they would sit back and let stories float around with my name being
        dragged through the mud.
      </p>
      <p>
        This obsession with assigning the role of a villain and a victim in a
        story where the victim is the storyteller is so inadequate to form an
        absolute opinion. However, this is what happens in the real world.
        People believe easily because pursuing the truth is a difficult ordeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my time at the institute, I had a couple of relationships that ended
        on a sour note. Not ugly but sad nonetheless. What followed was a
        classic case of Chinese Whispers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stories about me reached my ears with zero semblance to reality. If
        these gossip mongers were to stop and ask the two people actually
        involved in the story, I am sure that they would have been met with
        explicit disagreement. But that wasn’t the case and I’m not quite sure
        whether the truths were skewed in the dissemination of information, in
        the head of the other person or in my own recollection of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, I had a group of juniors who were initially my mentees but
        ended up becoming my only friends at the institute. In a recent
        conversation with one of them, he mentioned that he had overheard a
        petty incident and could not believe it to be true, for it went against
        his image of my character. Initially, I restrained myself from blurting
        out my side of the story, for it felt like an unneeded chain of
        mud-slinging. But then I realised, that if I don’t stand up for myself
        then who will?
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/notes/2022_undergraduate-study/7.webp" />
        <figcaption>
          Three of the closest friends I have at the moment. Two are missing in
          this photograph.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I wish I had done this earlier on as well but I decided to run away from
        it. I isolated myself, shifted cities and found solace in new friends.
        This isn’t the right thing to do. Every time I entered the institute
        after leaving it in January, I felt its hostility bite into my skin.
        That isn’t a pleasant feeling to associate with such a wonderful
        institute and my wonderful time there, if one looks at the larger scheme
        of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re hearing things about yourself that aren’t true, stand up for
        yourself otherwise the world loves to blame a villain and life amidst
        the blamers becomes living hell.
      </p>
      <h1>Saying no and nitpicking:</h1>
      <p>
        No was my go-to answer in college. No to parties, no to drugs, no to
        alcohol, no to social gatherings, no to events … no to pretty much
        everything that you can think of.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few months into college, I observed people around me use means of
        intoxication. I, on the other hand, had developed a strong aversion to
        it at an earlier stage as more and more people around me had succumbed
        to the social pressure of ‘trying it out’. The problem here wasn’t the
        intoxication itself but the fact that I looked down on people who
        consumed it. This led to a major dissociation between me and the college
        community.
      </p>
      <p>
        In design school, it is almost stereotypically accepted that everyone
        has either tried / or continues to consume some substance or alcohol.
        Some don’t. Most do. What I didn’t realise at that time was that it is a
        conscious life choice that people make. Neither perspective is absolute
        and, therefore, you should not expect everyone to align with your own.
        When my friends started bowing down to the social pressure of doing
        these activities, I looked down on them as if they were weaker
        individuals. I loathed their inability to stay true to who they were
        without realising that this is a change that they’re consciously making
        to themselves and that I should try and accept the evolution of their
        character. It’s just an add on, not a change to their entire
        personality.
      </p>
      <p>
        I held the same dislike for most other social gatherings. Fests, clubs
        and house parties were considered meaningless activities. I usually
        spent the same time either reading or climbing or working. While this
        led to immense self-growth, I now feel deprived of experiences that most
        of my peers had.

          While this image was taken as an internal joke to emulate the original
          image by
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hoseok_lee93/?hl=en">Hoseok Lee</a
          >, this is usually how my free time was spent; minus the theatrics.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        While I don’t mean to tell you to go out and become a junkie, remember
        where your ‘no’ is coming from. If it’s coming from a place where the
        activity at hand collides with your morals as a person, then that’s
        okay. But if it comes from a place of judgement because your 19-year-old
        self thinks that this isn’t the way to live life, then that is
        problematic.

        And that’s it. Four years at a place of immense learning, diverse
        experiences and life-changing times; summarised neatly into three points
        of pride and three points of regret. In the next chapter of my life, I
        wish to begin anew and not repeat the same mistakes twice. For you, I
        wish that this article informs your approach to college, or to life and
        even if it contributes just a little, I am grateful.

      <p>
        While ending this article, I wanted to thank everyone involved in my
        journey. I sat down and began thanking everyone by name. Halfway through
        the list, I realised that it was extremely lengthy and I doubt that I’d
        be able to cover everyone who impacted my life. If you’re reading this
