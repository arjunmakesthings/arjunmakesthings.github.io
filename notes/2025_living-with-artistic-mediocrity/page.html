        i have grown up, now, to treat my practice with discipline and patience.
        to fight off dangerous feelings of unrealised ambition and ineptitude, i
        wrote myself this reminder:
      </p>
      <p>
        i permit myself to come in today,<br />
        and make something hideous.
      </p>

      <p>something worthless, repulsive or downright ugly.</p>
      <p>
        and i promise to show up again tomorrow,<br />
        and day-after-tomorrow,<br />
        and day-after-day-after-tomorrow;<br />
        until the genius has nowhere else to go.
