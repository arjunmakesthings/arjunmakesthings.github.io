        A little over a year ago, I purchased a worn-out copy of
        <em>‘Yours Faithfully: Letters From The Famous About God’</em>
        — authored by Jeff Thorburn — from a second-hand bookshop in Bengaluru.
      </p>
      <p>
        The anthology contained 120+ views on God & life, by people who had
        supposedly ‘made it’ — celebrities, leaders, and the likes. More than a
        hundred ‘valuable’ life philosophies for me to choose from, select, rob
        and live by. However, none of them stuck; except two lines by Esther
        Rantzen in the foreword:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “All the same a pattern emerges from this anthology. These are all
          people who have explored their own beliefs, they have clearly
          struggled over the years to decide whether life is merely a series of
          random accidents, or if they are fulfilling a designed destiny.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        My search for meaning has evidenced the futility of the activity. People
        don’t <em>find</em> meaning, they <em>create</em> it — using
        self-acknowledged ways of leading lives, amidst murky distinctions
        between right & wrong, in a grand resounding of the fact that life is
        best lived as a subjective experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tiny piece of writing is an attempt to define how I wish to lead my
        life, with the help of six concrete aphorisms that I am trying to live
        (early) adulthood by.

        Growing up, nobody warned me about the dangers of living a life fuelled
        by extrinsic motivation. Somehow, I formed the inaccurate notion that
        life was best lived as an <em>outward</em> pursuit — chasing numbers,
        awards, acceptances and recognition. External achievement became the
        sole reason for pursuing activities, diametrically opposed to why I
        wrongly dribbled a basketball with both hands in the verandah when I was
        4.
      </p>

      <p>
        My relationship with sports evidences the dangers of living such a life,
        where enjoyable activities are robbed of their joy and are taken over by
        an insatiable hunger to stand above the rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am convinced that I wish to lead my life as an
        <em>inward</em> pursuit, exploring & chasing feelings with the
        understanding of an adult.

      <h1>Slow down, you crazy child</h1>
      <p>This year, I was introduced to the idea of ‘slowness’.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>in a fast-moving world, slow is revolutionary.</p>
        <br />

      <p>
        In all my years of chasing results faster than I could achieve them, the
        idea of ‘taking time’ remained alien to me. Now that I’m older, privy to
        how other people think about their lives and having bore my fair share
        of ‘fast-pace-depreciation’, I understand that good (and bad) things
        take time, and that that’s okay.

        Billy Joel asks “where’s the fire, what’s the hurry about” in his song
        <em>Vienna</em>, and, in the silence of the answer to that question, his
        words resound the idea of slowing down in my head:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Slow down you crazy child <br />
          You’re so ambitious for a juvenile<br />
          …<br />
          Where’s the fire, what’s the hurry about?<br />
          You better cool it off before you burn it out<br />
          You got so much to do and only <br />
          So many hours in a day<br />

        The tiny article that you’re reading right now has taken me more than 2
        months to develop, and I’ve never been prouder of a piece of written
        work.

      <h1>Tenderness & flowers</h1>
      <p>
        A term that has made its way in my life and stayed is
        <em>tenderness</em>. My mentor asks:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Despite everything that happened, amidst all the thorns, hurt & pain,
          can you still treat the situation with tenderness?
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This is incredibly challenging to do and, maybe, it’ll take me an entire
        lifetime to learn how to be <em>tender</em>. For the last couple of
        years, I’ve begun keeping flowers in the living room of my house, as a
        subtle reminder to be tender to the prickly thorns outside.

      <h1>Permission to feel</h1>
      <p>
        Even though I believe that I grew up in relatively open environments,
        certain degrees & kinds of feelings were still restricted to isolated
        corners. Despite public ridicule, I could never <em>stop</em> myself
        from feeling what I felt. I could bury them, and do it well, but I now
        know the accumulated hurt they can bring when they inevitably rise up.
      </p>
      <p>s recently said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I didn’t know to what extent you could feel, but now I know you feel a
          lot. Like a lot.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        That statement eased me into a small well of acceptance within myself.
        Yes, maybe I <em>do</em> feel a lot, and maybe it’s not such a bad
        thing. For years, my creative practice has rested on my ability to
        <em>feel</em> and, going forward, I would like to give myself the
        <em>permission to feel</em> — even absurd things like feeling abandoned
        by a dog, feeling annoyed amidst love and feeling unheard despite
        talking.

      <h1>It’s just a wave</h1>
      <p>Words from a John Mayer song sum up this one up concisely:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          It’s just a wave and I know<br>
           That when it comes<br>
            I just hold on

      <p>
        Living by the sea for a couple of years has given rise to an analogical thread between waves and life — all things, good or bad, rise up in places you can’t see, grow to an unexpected peak and come crashing down the shore to make space for the next one.
      </p>
      <p>
        This eventuality is inevitable — the rising and crashing of waves, just like the rising and crashing of good & bad things in life. Some waves hit harder and some waves take longer to settle, but all of them do and the shore sits idly, waiting for the next one.

      <h1>factors</h1>
      <p>
        Life seems to be made up of certain unavoidable ‘factors’. Here is an acknowledgement of some:
      </p>
      <p>activities:<br>
        I must do things with my time, for different reasons. Some activities for sustenance, while others for joy. Pursuing activities for a single reason can be hazardous. Balance is key.</p>
        <p>Environment:<br>
          I do not exist in a vacuum, and am always surrounded by things — organisms, chemicals, objects, air. All the things that surround me, over time, affect my personality. Therefore, I must be selective, without being rigid, and consciously design the environment I exist in.</p>
          <p>People:<br>
            Even though I fancied it as a teenager, it is virtually impossible for me to live alone like Thoreau at Walden Pond. I like human connections and, although I can (and will be) excruciatingly selective, I cannot be completely devoid of them.</p>
            <p>Money:<br>
              I grew up with a frugal mindset, paired with hot-blood rebelliousness against capitalistic tendencies. However, as I grow older, I understand that money has its own space in the world and I must make <em>some</em>, if not <em>much</em>.</p>
              <p>Relationship with Self:<br>
                I’ve run around trying to repair relationships with everyone, barring the most important one — with myself. My body & mind have been willingly abused, and it is time that I attempt to nurture them, just like I attempt to do with external relationships.</p>
