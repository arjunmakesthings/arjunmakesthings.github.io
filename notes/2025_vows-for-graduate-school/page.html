        <p>it’s gotten to the point that ITP has pretty much infected all of NY’s tech companies. And that’s a good thing ... it’s a special place that turns out special people who do special things.</p>

        three years have gone by since my last university experience, and i continue to live in its aftermath<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup
        >. itp is my chance to do it again, and make different choices.
      </p>
      <p>so, i choose to take 5 vows for graduate school:</p>
      <h1>say yes:</h1>
      <p>i've lived, prematurely saying no-s to unknowns. this time, i want to <mark>say more yes-es</mark>; unless it's ethically-wrong for me to do so.</p>
      <h1>absorb:</h1>
      <p>it is crystal-clear that there are no absolute right-s. functioning out of a <a href="https://thesciencesurvey.com/features/2023/12/28/new-york-citys-tapestry-of-diversity-a-multicultural-melting-pot/" target="_blank">multicultural melting-pot</a>, i shall try to absorb as much as i can; so that i <mark>leave with diversely-informed stances.</mark></p>
      <h1>walk out with friends:</h1>
      <p>
        from my previous note on <em><a href="/notes/2022_undergraduate-study/page.html">undergraduate-study</a></em
        >:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What stung me the most as I walked out of the gates of my college for the last time was the number of people in my batch that I interacted with on my last day and conversed beyond small talk. Zero.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>people at the itp are supposed to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search" target="_blank">nearest-neighbour</a>(s) to the things that i am interested in — i, perhaps, expect to feel a sense of belonging in the community.</p>
      <p>i'd like to <mark>walk at my graduation, with friendships</mark> that are promised to last.</p>
      <h1>exhaust:</h1>
      <p>i complained about having to live a split-life — that of a designer, and that of an artist. now, i have two years to pour all my time into a single bucket, and i'd like to <mark>leave the itp exhausted of ideas</mark> to execute.</p>
      <h1>maintain:</h1>
      <p>painstakingly, i have built good health, relationships, ethical stances, and a certain way to live. i shall <mark>not put these in jeopardy, and only change them for betterment</mark>.</p>
