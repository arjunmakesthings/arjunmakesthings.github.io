        sometimes, i see all of you.<br />
        jolly times, collectives smiles and unending gossip.<br />
        i've observed, listened and craved,<br />
        for a while now.
      </p>

      <p>
        sitting at the corner table,<br />
        invisible.<br />
        walking by the group photos,<br />
        excluded.<br />
        watching you leave with each other,<br />
        isolated.<br />
        overhearing your conversations,<br />
        voiceless.<br />
        comparing your life with mine,<br />
        empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        i've seen what this college looks like<br />
        way into the night,<br />
        as all of you rush into your merry homes, while i turn off the
        lights.<br />
        funnily enough,<br />
        nights are when it becomes easy,<br />
        as i'm not on the outside anymore<br />
        because the inside collapses within me.
      </p>

      <p>
        i wondered,<br />
        talked,<br />
        questioned,<br />
        tried,<br />
        and failed.<br />
        nothing ever worked,<br />
        and not knowing the reason behind my inevitable fate,<br />
        became unbearable.<br />
        so, i packed my bags,<br />
        and shifted cities;<br />
        it's been four months since.
      </p>

      <p>
        days are easier,<br />
        nights get tougher.<br />
        as the internet mocks me,<br />
        with updates from your space.<br />
        it's just like before,<br />
        and nothing really changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        i sit here,<br />
        miles away,<br />
        and i watch you,<br />
        hear you,<br />
        and desire what you have.<br />
        but you render my virtual presence invisible,<br />
        as if i'm not even there.
      </p>

      <p>
        the morning light hits,<br />
        and i type away on my computer,<br />
        hoping that, someday, i'll be:
      </p>

      <p>
        sitting at the center table,<br />
        visible.<br />
        walking into group photos,<br />
        included.<br />
        leaving with everyone,<br />
        together.<br />
        hearing your conversations,<br />
        vocal.<br />
        comparing your life to mine,<br />
        fulfilled.
