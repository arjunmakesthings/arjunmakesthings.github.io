        in 2021, as part of my third-year undergraduate work, i attempted the
        <a href="https://www.istd.org.uk/">istd</a> student brief which read:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          What can a typographer do to address the imbalance, to harness, shape
          and organise words in service of breaking barriers? To encourage
          reflection, respect, and self-awareness between communities?
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        the brief also put forth starting points, and exposed me to
        gil-scott-heron’s poetry & the media theories of marshall mcluhan.

      <p>
        as i began unravelling global racial, sexist, political and religious
        imbalances,
        <a
          href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suman-bhandary?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAh6rwABYmMtrIAY84KB2PoBLYh577ofKq4&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BjScCX3vlQ9SQTv5OqrUD7A%3D%3D"
          >suman</a

        asked me to look at issues closer to home. over time, my heart settled
        on issues that often go unaddressed, and i decided to hone in on ‘casual
        racism’ against northeastern migrants in delhi.

        i saw a poetic link between the latin alphabet and human beings — each
        individual was different, but part of the same larger system. so, i used
        a system of letters to show the different kinds of injustices faced by
        northeastern migrants in delhi, and supplemented it with evidence.
