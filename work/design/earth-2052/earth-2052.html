        present a public engagement project at the annual
        <a href="https://sciencegallery.org/youth-symposium">youth symposium</a

        we chose to steer away from traditional ‘scientific’ enquiries, and
        wished to do something with crowdsourced qualitative data; partly
        inspired by the
        <a

          >work of guerilla science</a
        >. so, we put up a small stall at a local event in bengaluru, and asked
        200+ young adults to draw what they thought the earth would look like,
        30 years into the future, given the current climate-crisis. each drawing
        was then manually analysed and the findings were shared at the
        symposium, in an attempt to reduce ‘<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-anxiety"
          >climate-anxiety</a
        >’ amongst the youth.

        the responses we gathered turned out to be extremely diverse. some were
        grim — depicting the earth as a grand ball of fire — while others
        displayed belief in collective climate-positive-actions, such as
        renewable energy and sustainable consume choices. some placed their
        optimism in the abilities of tech-moguls, hoping that they would swoop
        in at the last minute with a giant water hose to cool down the earth,
        while others believed technology could achieve nothing more than
        enslaving human beings in the future (and, hence, climate wouldn’t
        matter anyway).

        the first bit of analysis we performed was to tag each drawing based on
        its sentiment — was the drawing largely <em>positive</em> or
        <em>negative</em>? in some cases, we couldn’t judge or arrive at a
        consensus, and marked them as neutral.

      </figure>
      <p>
        as i engaged more with the drawings, i realised that each drawing could
        be summed up with a few keywords (such as
        <em>trees, buildings, deforestation, et-cetera</em>). so, we looked at
        each drawing and manually identified keywords and themes.

      <p>
        this became a rich starting point for computational imagery. i wondered
        what a ‘collective’ visual would look like, and fed the top 20 most
        frequently occurring keywords to open-access-ai-engines.

        finally, during the symposium, we connected our findings to
        ‘climate-anxiety’ — a term coined by glenn albrecht to bucket heightened
        emotional and psychological distress to the globally worsening climate
        situation. the idea was to show young adults around the world that other
        people their age were feeling similar things, irrespective of their
        geographies. we ended our presentation by facilitating a discussion
        between viewers about coping mechanisms and prospective climate futures
        that the world may experience (and how we may prepare (emotionally) for
        the same).
