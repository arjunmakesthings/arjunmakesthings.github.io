      <p>as part of the <a href = "https://bengaluru.sciencegallery.com/xperimenter-programme">xperimenters</a>-cohort at science gallery bengaluru, the four of us were asked to present a public engagement project at the annual <a href = "https://sciencegallery.org/youth-symposium">youth symposium</a>. that year, the symposium was titled ‘hot & bothered’, and aimed to engage young people around the world in the global climate-crisis discourse.</p>
      <p>we chose to steer away from traditional ‘scientific’ enquiries, and wished to do something with crowdsourced qualitative data; partly inspired by the work of <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/18xa9A2Ickfn3uSwrtyFqRisg7HfD1up1/view">guerrilla science</a>. so, we put up a small stall at a local event in bengaluru, and asked 200+ young adults to draw what they think the earth would look like, 30 years into the future, given the current climate-crisis. each drawing was then manually analysed, and the findings were shared via a presentation at the symposium.</p>
